              Hi, my name is Pau Martori and I am a{" "}
              <span className="font-bold">highly ambitious</span>,
              <span className="font-bold">proactive</span>, and
              <span className="font-bold"> efficient</span> software engineer
              based in Barcelona, Spain.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              I graduated from &apos;Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya (UPC)&apos;, Barcelona in 2023
              with a BS in Computer Science, specializing in the Software Engineering path. I&apos;ve been coding on my own since I started my studies and have worked as a freelancer since my second year in college (2019).
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
            I&apos;ve merged my love for coding with interests in fashion, sports, and music. Starting with web scraping to purchase limited-edition shoes, I expanded into the sneaker bot business. This passion also led me to create bots for acquiring exclusive items like limited concert tickets and tickets for big sports events like the UEFA Champions League. In both cases, my software helped me purchase the tickets I wanted despite their low availability. My hobbies aren&apos;t just pastimes; they fuel my innovation and creativity.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
            My projects showcase my ambition and commitment to excellence. From contributing to the blockchain sector to creating personalized bots for purchasing limited items, I&apos;ve pursued a wide array of challenges. My ability to rapidly learn new languages and frameworks, along with my perfectionist approach, ensures success and quality in everything I undertake.
